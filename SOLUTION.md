## Exercise 5: Reflection Questions

### 1. Why is MFA important even for a personal learning account?

**Your Answer:**
MFA reduces the risk of people accessing your account by 99%. Even if someone accessed my personal learning account they can use services outside of the free allowance meaning I would be charged for this.

---

### 2. What would happen if you left your root user unprotected?

**Your Answer:**
Would have full access to my AWS account and could create instances and use other services outside of my free tier. They could also steal sensitive data. I could resolve this by resetting my login details and resetting my MFA details.

---

### 3. How do billing alerts help prevent unexpected charges?

**Your Answer:**
Billing alerts help because you are notified when your charges are exceeding a certain amount delegated by the user. These alerts can be sent through multiple ways such as email. This allows you to make any changes to prevent further charges. This is important as being constantly ontop of billing will help to ensure there are no unexpected charges and also that you are being efficient.
